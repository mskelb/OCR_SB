## About this repository 
ðŸ“Œ This repository provides scripts for training an ensemble of five character recognition models using a crossâ€“â€“folding technique. These experiments are based on the research outlined in the paper 'OCR Processing of Swedish Historical Newspapers Using Deep Hybrid CNNâ€“LSTM Networks': [OCR Processing of Swedish Historical Newspapers Using Deep Hybrid CNNâ€“LSTM Networks](https://acl-bg.org/proceedings/2021/RANLP%202021/pdf/2021.ranlp-1.23.pdf). 

ðŸ“Œ The experiments, conducted with the openâ€“â€“source OCR engine Calamari, showcased the superiority of mixed deep CNNâ€“â€“LSTM hybrid models over previous methods for character recognition of Swedish historical newspaper text dated between 1818 and 1848. The models achieved an average character accuracy rate (CAR) of 97.43%, setting a new stateâ€“â€“ofâ€“â€“theâ€“â€“art standard in the analysis of 19thâ€“â€“century Swedish newspaper text.

## Instructions for the commandâ€“line interface

### Training 
The `calamari-cross-fold-train` command will train an ensemble of 5 models based on a crossâ€“fold of the provided training data. Training duration is adapted by the `--early_stopping_nbest=5` parameter.

	usage: calamari-cross-fold-train --network=cnn=80:3x3,pool=2x2,cnn=100:3x3,pool=2x2,lstm=200,dropout=0.5,lstm=200,dropout=0.5 --files path_to_training_data/*.png --best_models_dir some_output_dir --early_stopping_nbest=5 
### Voting
Confidence voting to different predictions of the five best models.
  
 	 usage: calamari-predict --checkpoint path_to_model_0.ckpt ... path_to_model_4.ckpt --files path_to_test_data/*.bin.png --output_dir some_output_dir
### Evaluation
Evaluate the predicted sentences produced by the `calamari-predict` script against the provided ground truth.

	 usage: calamari-eval --gt path_to_test_data/*.gt.txt --pred path_to_predictions/*.pred.txt
